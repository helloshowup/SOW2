Based on your AI Agent Workflow Research Summary and your `README.md` outlining the development plan, here are relevant repositories from my research that align with your technical stack and workflow components. I'll categorize them by their primary utility to help you integrate them effectively.

### Core Workflow Components & Best Practices

1.  **Automated Daily Web Scraping and Content Evaluation:**

      * **Robust Web Scraping (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium` for dynamic content):**
          * **General Best Practices & Error Handling:** The principles discussed in articles about robust scraping with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` are key. These include implementing retry logic with exponential backoff for `HTTPError` and `Timeout` exceptions, and handling common parsing errors like `AttributeError` by checking for `None` before accessing element attributes.
          * **Handling Dynamic Content:** `Selenium` remains the go-to for JavaScript-rendered pages. While a full browser instance might be heavy for an MVP, consider `WebDriverManager` for easier setup and headless browser options.
          * **`robots.txt` Compliance:** Always parse and respect `robots.txt` before scraping a site.
      * **OpenAI API Integration (Content Evaluation & Dynamic Categorization):**
          * **OpenAI Cookbook (Conceptual):** While the direct link was not consistently accessible during research, the *concepts* within the OpenAI Cookbook (e.g., prompt engineering for content evaluation, using system messages, few-shot learning for classification) are highly relevant.
          * **Prompt Engineering Examples:** Resources demonstrating best practices for prompt engineering, like using a system message to define the model's persona, specifying desired output formats (e.g., JSON), and providing examples for few-shot learning, are crucial for dynamic categorization and content scoring.
              * *Example Prompt Strategy:*
                ```python
                SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
                You are an expert content evaluator for a market research firm.
                Your task is to analyze news articles, academic papers, and industry reports.
                For each piece of content, provide a relevance score (0-5), a source credibility score (0-5),
                and categorize it based on consumer interest.
                Output your response in JSON format.
                Categories include: [Technology, Finance, Health, Environment, Social Trends, Other].
                """

                USER_PROMPT = f"""
                Evaluate the following content:
                Title: {article_title}
                Content Snippet: {article_snippet}
                Source URL: {article_url}

                Provide a JSON object with 'relevance_score', 'credibility_score', 'category', and 'summary'.
                """
                # Use openai.ChatCompletion.create or client.chat.completions.create
                ```
          * **`Swiftorial` Text Classification Example:** Provides a basic Python example for text classification using the OpenAI API, which can be adapted for your dynamic categorization needs.

2.  **Simple Python-based Email Workflows:**

      * **Sending Summaries with `smtplib` and `email.mime`:** Your preference for `smtplib` and `email` libraries is a best practice.
          * **HTML Emails for Clickable Forms/Links:** Use `email.mime.text.MIMEText` with `_subtype='html'` to embed clickable links for feedback.
          * **Generating Unique Links:** Employ Python's `uuid` module to generate unique identifiers for each content piece and embed them as query parameters in feedback links. This allows you to link specific feedback to specific content.
              * *Example Link Generation:*
                ```python
                import uuid
                feedback_id = uuid.uuid4()
                feedback_link = f"http://your_feedback_server.com/feedback?id={feedback_id}&rating=" # rating will be appended by client-side JS or pre-filled links
                ```
      * **Receiving Structured Feedback via Clickable Forms or Embedded Links (Minimal Flask App):**
          * Since you're avoiding a full web framework for the agent, a **minimal Flask application** running separately is the most pragmatic way to receive structured feedback from clickable links.
          * **Flask for Receiving GET Requests:** A basic Flask endpoint can capture feedback sent as URL parameters.
              * *Example Flask Endpoint:*
                ```python
                # feedback_app.py (a separate, minimal Flask application)
                from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
                import sqlite3

                app = Flask(__name__)

                DATABASE = 'feedback.db'

                def get_db_connection():
                    conn = sqlite3.connect(DATABASE)
                    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row # Allows accessing columns by name
                    return conn

                @app.route('/feedback', methods=['GET'])
                def receive_feedback():
                    feedback_id = request.args.get('id')
                    rating = request.args.get('rating') # e.g., 'yes', 'no', '1', '5'
                    comment = request.args.get('comment', '') # Optional comment field

                    if not feedback_id or not rating:
                        return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": "Missing ID or rating"}), 400

                    try:
                        conn = get_db_connection()
                        conn.execute("INSERT INTO content_feedback (feedback_uuid, rating, comment, timestamp) VALUES (?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)",
                                     (feedback_id, rating, comment))
                        conn.commit()
                        conn.close()
                        return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": "Feedback received"}), 200
                    except sqlite3.Error as e:
                        return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": str(e)}), 500

                if __name__ == '__main__':
                    # Ensure feedback table exists
                    conn = get_db_connection()
                    conn.execute('''
                        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS content_feedback (
                            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                            feedback_uuid TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
                            rating TEXT NOT NULL,
                            comment TEXT,
                            timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
                        );
                    ''')
                    conn.commit()
                    conn.close()
                    app.run(port=5000) # Run on a specific port, e.g., 5000
                ```
          * *Note:* The "clickable forms" aspect might refer to simple HTML forms that pre-fill a rating or allow a comment, then submit to this Flask endpoint. For binary (yes/no) feedback, two distinct links are simpler (e.g., `.../feedback?id={uuid}&rating=yes` and `.../feedback?id={uuid}&rating=no`).

3.  **Efficiently Storing and Retrieving Feedback Data using a Local SQLite Database:**

      * **SQLite Best Practices:** Your plan to use SQLite is excellent for a local MVP.
          * **Schema Design:** For feedback, consider a schema like:
            ```sql
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS content_feedback (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                feedback_uuid TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- To link to the original email/content
                content_id TEXT,                    -- Optional: if you generate internal content IDs
                rating TEXT NOT NULL,               -- e.g., 'yes', 'no', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5'
                comment TEXT,                       -- Optional text feedback
                timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
            );
            ```
            *For initial binary feedback, `rating` can be 'yes' or 'no'. For a 1-5 scale, it can be an INTEGER.*
          * **`sqlite3` Module for CRUD Operations:** Python's built-in `sqlite3` module is straightforward for basic operations.
              * *Example Insertion:*
                ```python
                import sqlite3

                def store_feedback(feedback_uuid, rating, comment=""):
                    conn = sqlite3.connect('feedback.db')
                    cursor = conn.cursor()
                    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO content_feedback (feedback_uuid, rating, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                                   (feedback_uuid, rating, comment))
                    conn.commit()
                    conn.close()

                # Example usage:
                # store_feedback("some_uuid_here", "yes", "Very relevant content!")
                ```
              * *Example Retrieval:*
                ```python
                def get_all_feedback():
                    conn = sqlite3.connect('feedback.db')
                    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row # Access columns by name
                    cursor = conn.cursor()
                    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM content_feedback ORDER BY timestamp DESC")
                    feedback_entries = cursor.fetchall()
                    conn.close()
                    return feedback_entries

                # for entry in get_all_feedback():
                #     print(dict(entry))
                ```

4.  **Externally Editable Prompt Configurations:**

      * **JSON or Plaintext Files:** This is a strong best practice for managing prompts externally.
          * **JSON for Structured Prompts:** Use JSON files for more complex prompts that might include multiple parts, examples (for few-shot learning), or model parameters. Python's `json` module makes loading straightforward.
              * *Example `prompts.json` structure:*
                ```json
                {
                    "content_evaluation_prompt": {
                        "system": "You are an expert content evaluator...",
                        "user_template": "Evaluate the following content:\nTitle: {title}\nContent Snippet: {snippet}\nSource URL: {url}\n\nProvide a JSON object with 'relevance_score', 'credibility_score', 'category', and 'summary'.",
                        "output_format": "json"
                    },
                    "categorization_prompt": {
                        "system": "Categorize the following text...",
                        "categories": ["Technology", "Finance", "Health", "Environment"],
                        "user_template": "Text: {text}\nCategory:"
                    }
                }
                ```
              * *Python Loading:*
                ```python
                import json

                def load_prompts(filepath='prompts.json'):
                    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
                        return json.load(f)

                # prompts = load_prompts()
                # eval_prompt = prompts['content_evaluation_prompt']['user_template'].format(title=..., snippet=..., url=...)
                ```
          * **Jinja2 for Templating Prompts (`abilzerian/LLM-Prompt-Library`):** This repository demonstrates using Jinja2 templates, which allows for highly dynamic and reusable prompt structures with placeholders that can be filled in at runtime. This is excellent for managing variations of prompts or complex prompt chains.
              * *Consider this for more advanced prompt management beyond simple static strings.*
              * *Example `eval_template.jinja2`:*
                ```jinja2
                SYSTEM: You are an expert content evaluator for a market research firm.
                USER: Evaluate the following content:
                Title: {{ title }}
                Content Snippet: {{ snippet }}
                Source URL: {{ url }}

                Provide a JSON object with 'relevance_score', 'credibility_score', 'category', and 'summary'.
                ```
              * *Python with Jinja2:*
                ```python
                from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader

                def load_templated_prompt(template_name, **kwargs):
                    env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader('prompts_templates')) # Folder containing templates
                    template = env.get_template(template_name)
                    return template.render(**kwargs)

                # user_prompt = load_templated_prompt('eval_template.jinja2', title=article_title, snippet=article_snippet, url=article_url)
                ```

### Integrated Projects for Architectural Inspiration:

These repositories demonstrate how multiple components can be combined into a functional system.

1.  **`jarif87/daily-email-report`**:

      * **Relevance:** This project directly aligns with your goal of sending daily email summaries. It provides a good structure for integrating data processing with email delivery.
      * **Key Learnings:** Look at how it schedules tasks, gathers data, formats the email content, and sends it. It will likely showcase `smtplib` usage for a real-world scenario.
      * **Areas to Focus On:** `scheduler` implementation, email content generation, and error handling for the email sending process.

2.  **`ShivamB25/Research-Analysist`**:

      * **Relevance:** This is an AI-powered research assistant, which directly mirrors parts of your content evaluation and summarization needs.
      * **Key Learnings:** Pay attention to how it integrates LLMs, performs content analysis, and structures the overall workflow. It might offer insights into managing different stages of content processing (fetching, parsing, analyzing, summarizing).
      * **Areas to Focus On:** LLM interaction patterns, data flow between modules, and how it handles different types of inputs or outputs.

### Documentation and Scalability (General Best Practices):

  * **Modular Design:** Break down your system into distinct, manageable modules (e.g., `scraper.py`, `evaluator.py`, `email_sender.py`, `db_manager.py`, `config_loader.py`). This enhances readability, maintainability, and testability.
  * **Configuration Management:** Your `README.md` already outlines `python-dotenv` and environment variables, which is a solid approach for managing sensitive information and environment-specific settings.
  * **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging (as outlined in your `README.md` with `structlog`) to track execution flow, debug issues, and monitor performance. This is critical for an automated system.
  * **Error Handling:** Beyond basic try-except blocks, implement a centralized error handling strategy (e.g., custom exception classes, decorators, or a dedicated error reporting function that sends email notifications to `hello@showup.courses` as specified).
  * **Dependency Management:** Use `pipenv` or `Poetry` for robust dependency management.
  * **Testing:** Write unit tests for individual components (e.g., scraper parsing logic, prompt generation, database interactions) and integration tests for the overall workflow.
  * **Cost Estimation (OpenAI API):** While you prefer to avoid usage-based cost APIs *for scraping*, the OpenAI API incurs costs. Integrate logic to estimate token usage per call and accumulate it to provide running cost calculations. The OpenAI API response typically includes token usage in its `usage` field.
      * *Example:*
        ```python
        # After an OpenAI API call
        response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
        prompt_tokens = response.usage.prompt_tokens
        completion_tokens = response.usage.completion_tokens
        total_tokens = response.usage.total_tokens

        # Use OpenAI's pricing page (e.g., $0.0005 / 1K tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct)
        # to calculate estimated cost. Store this in your SQLite DB.
        ```
